# BattleShipFrontEnd

This is the project front end effort for the course SOEN 6441.

Please use the scene builder for any chnages in the component.

Steps to use scene builder:

-> Open the file in scene builder.

-> Add components as you may like or required.

-> For action events go to code on the right hand rail, last accordion.

-> Go to view, at the bottom there is tab named, show sample controller skeleton, open it. Find your function and copy it to the eclipse contoller file.

Simply run the program, the window is not fixed and it relative to the parent so you may need to fix it.

Rest to follow.
